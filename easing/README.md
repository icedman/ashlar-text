## UNMAINTAINED

I don't use openframeworks these days so I can't review pull requests or issues. 
If you're using it and have an up to date / maintained fork let me know and I'll add a link here.


## Original readme

A port of Robert Penner's easing equations to c++.

You can download an openframeworks usage example here
